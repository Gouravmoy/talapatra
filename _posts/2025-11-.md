![Happy Go Lucky](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a7/Happy_go_lucky.jpg)

A good friend of mine is a fan of Hollywood movies released in early 2000’s. She believes that the movies of that era were much better than the current ones which I concur with. Many of the best movies I have seen and loved are from the late 90's and the early 2000s. Especially romantic comedies like Forest Gump, Castaway, Sleepless in Seattle, Meet Joe Black, You Have Got Mail, and many others. 

Yesterday I watched the movie [Happy-Go-Lucky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1045670/) (2008), a romantic comedy set in London. Earlier I had spent 20 mins on Prime Movies looking for some light-hearted movies to watch when I stumbled upon this movie. And even though I had no idea what the movie was or without knowing whether it was any good, two reasons pulled me to watch the movie.

One obviously was that it was released in the early 2000s. Second, in the thumbnail of the movie there was this character who looked like the actress in the movie The Shape of Water (2017). As it turned out it was her - Sally Hawkins. I really liked her acting in both The Shape of Water as well as the Lost King.

From the very start of the movie, I was drawn into the theatrics of the happy go lucky Poppy (Pauline). One may initially be very skeptical of her abundance of optimism and joyfulness, especially considering the world we are now living in, you cannot but help but feel your spirits being lifted. She was a breath of fresh air.

I was especially moved by the scene of Poppy with the Tramp. The confrontation was never racking for me, as it is every time there is a realistic portrayal of mental illness in movies. I was genuinely concerned about her wellbeing. The schizophrenic Tramp character was also played exceptionally well by Stanley Townsend. The whole scene was strange and unnerving but very well acted.

The final confrontation between Poppy and Scott, the driving instructor, was also great. Eddie Marson played the heavily flawed character expertly. I am constantly amazed how actors so smoothly get into such difficult roles. Scott is angry with society, a conspiracy theorist, racist as well as misogynist, each of the characteristics having been played very naturally by Marson. At the end I was left with various degrees of emotion for Scott ranging from repulsion to sadness and pity.

I really like the movie. Having had a long day in the office, I wanted to relax and be entertained and this turned out to be the perfect movie for the occasion. In today's world of division, hate, inequality and intolerance I would want to sometimes be like Poppy. Optimistic, joyful, non-judgmental, trying to help others and taking life as it comes. The world can sometimes be too much for some people, too serious for some. Maybe it's not a bad idea to be a bit joyful and at peace with your own existence and the small life that you have built around yourself and the people you call your own.

En-ra-ha everyone! :)
