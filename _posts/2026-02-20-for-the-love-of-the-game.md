&emsp;I like the game of cricket. It is a game every Indian gets exposed to since childhood. I was no exception. Watching cricketing greats like Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid play was pure delight. I used to be excited about the matches and watched the full game even though it meant an entire day was wasted. Such were the joys of childhood :) 

&emsp;But over the years my interest in the game has waned. I think partly it is just growing up. Life catches up with you. Jobs, friends, girlfriends, marriage, family, responsibilities, quickly fill up whatever spare time you have. Cricket took a back seat. I started seeing fewer of these matches, sometimes only for a few hours rather than the entire day. As more and more cricket was played every year, less and less time I had to see them. But there is another, more uncomfortable reason too.

&emsp;Today, with the T20 Cricket World Cup going on, I was watching Australia play Sri Lanka. It was a very entertaining game, and I watched it from the first ball to the last and enjoyed it. At the same time, a few days ago, I was watching a match between India and Pakistan – a fiercely contested rivalry with a long history - and I could not stand to watch it. I realized then that I was *avoiding* seeing Indian cricket matches! I realized I was not avoiding bad cricket — I was avoiding the emotional weight attached to it. My feelings were more of irritation and discomfort. But why? And like all uncomfortable dissonant feelings, the reasons for this seem to be multi-faceted. 

## Rooting for the underdog

&emsp;I am someone who has always rooted for the underdog. Whichever sports I watch, I always root for the weaker team. I have the same feeling when I watch India play cricket with other teams as well. India, since the last couple of decades, has become one of the best cricketing teams in the world. Which means the other team usually is the weaker one, the underdog. While I like the Indian cricket team and a part of me would be sad if they lose the match, it is in my nature to support the weaker team. And this is where the dissonance, my feeling of discomfort lies. Let me explain why.

&emsp;In India, cricket is much more than just a game, it is a religion. People take it seriously and pride themselves on the team's victories. People experience ranges of emotions, from anger, despondency, sadness to outright hostility, when the team loses. Of late the performance of the team has become linked to national pride, especially matches with Pakistan where we have a long checkered history of rivalry. And this, the high emotions and the nationalist pride that has defined Indian cricket of late is making me lose interest in watching the game. 

&emsp;I am not a jingoistic person by nature. While I am deeply aware and have immense respect for my cultural roots, I am also aware of the good, bad and ugliness of the country where I have lived in for the past 35 years. So, I was surprised to realise that a sense of *guilt* has gotten embedded in me for not supporting my country in a cricket game. I was watching a previous India vs Pakistan match with a friend when Pakistan, already struggling against a potent Indian team, lost a wicket and a groan escaped my mouth. My friend looked at me strangely and asked me in a partially surprised tone if I was supporting Pakistan in this game. I did not know how to respond to my friend. I felt guilty.

## When the game becomes less

&emsp;I realized that like many I too fear social judgement. This fear makes me uncomfortable. It feels like today one cannot appreciate a good ball bowled by the opposition team as they are supposed to blindly support their own country. The opposition is always the enemy. Any kind of appreciation for the opposition and one feels like doing a mini betrayal towards ones country. It is like being under pressure to support your team, and by extension your country, to prove some abstract sense of belonging and pride.

&emsp;But when I see a match played between other countries – like the Sri Lanka vs Australia game for example, I feel like the invisible weight of expectations is lifted off my shoulders. There is no pressure about the match and its outcome. I still root for the underdog but without any feeling of guilt. I am more relaxed during the game, watching it dispassionately and enjoy the pure cricketing talent on display, the technical abilities of the batters and the bowlers, the mental and physical battles. The game feels much richer. Less seems to be at stake atleat for me. 

&emsp;I think that the sense of guilt I feel stems from the invisible pressure we feel nowadays to be more jingoistic. We are pressured to show patriotism and wear the love for our country on our sleeves, visible and loud for everyone to see. The current political climate surely does not help. You are made to feel like you are not patriotic enough. You do not care about your country enough. The constant barrage of nationalistic commentary in social media and news adds on to this feeling of inadequacy.

## What my country means to me

&emsp;I dislike the concept of jingoistic nationalism. To always consider that your country is the greatest and there is no other country better than yours is simply absurd to me. What my country means to me is much more personal. For me, it is a bouquet of emotions. They include the memories of the city I was born and grew up in. It’s the group of friends and families I lived and grew up with. The community of people around me who touched my life and shaped who I am. My country is my house - the small structure built of brick, mortar, and love - where my parents live and I call home on this planet. My country is the food I grew up eating and miss every day when I am abroad. It is also the people towards whom I have a deep sense of love, gratitude, and respect. It is the feeling of giving back to the people of my country some of the debt I feel I owe them.

&emsp;All of this, and more, is what my country means to me. Not the brutish uncompromising unquestioning jingoistic pride but a more subtle, humble and softer feeling. But I ask myself this - if this is how I feel, then why do I struggle when I want to support an underdog opponent? Why can’t I feel comfortable and secure knowing how I feel about my own country?

## Being kind to myself

&emsp;My rant aside, perhaps loving my country and loving the game do not need to be the same act. I plan to watch more games of other countries as they have put less emotional weight on my mind. And when I am watching a match where India is playing, and if I want to support the underdog opponent, I will try to be okay with my choice and cheer as the best team wins. I will try to rediscover my enjoyment for the game of cricket. This I will do for the love of the game.
