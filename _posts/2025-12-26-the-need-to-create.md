A few months ago, I had seen a TED talk wherein the speaker had, with almost a sense of urgency, insisted on the need for each of us to "create". And by creating, she meant creation of anything tangible. Let it be a photograph, a written down thought, or a piece of hand-drawn painting. She had asked the audience to imagine that if we died today, what would be our contribution to the society. What have we created and are leaving behind? Definitely not the endless scrolls on social media. Or the copious amount of information we consume every day. The speaker’s main appeal was to create more instead of consuming more.

Initially, the talk did not have any kind of profound effect on me. But like fine wine it slowly has matured inside me. Of late, whenever I read a beautifully written blogpost, or seen a photograph that been taken at the right moment or listened to beautiful song, I start having an overwhelming desire, more like a painful yearning, to create something similar. Every time something moves me, I remember the speaker in the talk appealing to the masses - To Create! 

When you create something tangible, you can feel that something new is born into this world. Something that was not there before. Something others may see, like or have an opinion about. Something completely and truly yours. Something you can be proud of. 

In today's world of never-ending streams of information, news, and entertainment, the more we consume the more we feel hollow and empty. Instead of feeling satiated, we still feel hungry. One is never satisfied after watching an hour of videos on YouTube or Instagram. On the contrary, we feel more drained than before. Not to mention the feeling of being anxious and fearful of things we are missing out on.

The act of creation is a feeling of fulfillment. It is a positive feeling, almost therapeutic. Instead of draining you out, it fills you with excitement and hope for the thing you are creating. Your creation takes a life of its own. You plan and research about it. And then for some time, you forget about the world and just create. Somehow your daily life and its worries take a back seat. You feel liberated from the daily mundane. You are finally and truly in the present. Isn’t that what meditation is all about?

And after you have created something, at least for some time, you bask in its glory. You are happy to have created something you can look at, feel with your hands, or taste. Then you may have an intense desire to share your creation with others, whether you want to share your creation with your friends and family, to the wider public or keep it just for yourself.

Days, months or years later, one day when you look back at what you created, you feel mixture of emotions. For me, the primary emotion is amazement. Did I really write this short story 15 years ago? How did I do it? Oh wow! This younger me was so much more creative than I am now. But it also fills me with pride, seeing my creations. Thinking about that one summer afternoon when I sat down and wrote down the story. Or got my clothes dirty trying to take a photograph of a landscape. Or hiked two kilometers into a flat riverbed with my tripod for a picture.

I notice that as I grow older, I am creating less. I hope to reverse this. I hope to create more in the coming few months. Maybe creating will help break the monotonous consumption-based routine I seem to have happily slid into. This is a shout out to my future self if he comes to read this piece of writing. Create - it makes you feel good. You do something good for yourself and others. I hope you are creating something new today. If you are, All the best! If not, go create something new today.
