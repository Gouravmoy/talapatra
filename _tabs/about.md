# Talapatra

Talapatra is an ancient way to writing in which words and drawings are scribe upon dried leaves of the Palm tree in the region of India I am from - Odisha. Before paper was common, people use to write and draw in talapatra. It was a way in which birth, death, star charts are recorded in olden times. It was also here that most sacred text like Ramayana and Mahabharata were written. 

I thought this would be a good name of my blog as I intend to have this as an recording of some of my thoughts and ideas which I feel the need or urge to record. I hope this will serve as a repository for all the knowledge I have and will be accumulating in my life. I am hoping to create posts about the topics I like like software engineering, books, photography, philosophy, short stories and life in general, something I can look back upon in the future.

Hi there, I am Gouravmoy Mohanty, an IT professional based in the Netherlands.I love spending time working on office projects (I know, kind of borning but I like it), watching TV shows & movies, reading, and listening to audiobooks. The last one quite a lot of it actually 😄. 

I started my career working for a QA team. As I was the only one who had the knowledge of how to code, I was given over the responsibility to manage the automation tool for the project. It was fun working on a small independent project and improving an existing product.After that I worked on creating an RCP (Rich Client Platform) based desktop application that will help QA team compare huge source and target datasets of any types (CSV, XML, database rows, etc.) and give them a report of the differences.

Next, I took over the role of Product Owner of my team. I was given the responsibility for a team of 8 members by the Director in my company. And even though I did not know much about PM, I took up the challenge. After that it has been more of a self discovery for me. I soon realized that I did not know much about what responsibilities my role encompasses. This is when I went online and started learning about how PM is done. What is Agile? How do I manage an Agile team? What are some processes that can be introduced to make the team work better? 

And I have never looked back from there. I have been managing a 10 member team and working cross functionally for close to 5 years now and it has been an awesome experience.

**Update 2023**

At present, I work as a Technical Product Owner in a Software Infrastructure team with a team of 4 immensely talented DevOps engineers.

During this transition, I changed from working primarily with Development teams to working DevOps team. Though initially this transition was tough for me, I have grown to enjoy the work and the new areas of software engineering it has opened up to me. From working on product features to managing performance, security, cost and maintenance of the Infrastructure platform upon which the product runs on has been a an challenging as well as satisfying growth in my career.
